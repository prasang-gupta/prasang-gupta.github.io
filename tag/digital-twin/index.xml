      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to test out some of the features offered by Worlds.io and create a generalised digital twin solution that can be leveraged in future projects. This would include generating a digital replication of their current environment and answer some of the questions based off of that with some additional analysis to allow clients to make better oeprational and strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;animation.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Solution Architecture&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the live footage provided by the vendor in New York City&amp;rsquo;s Bryant Park as a case study. A YOLO model was put on the raw camera footage to capture some common objects like people, bins, animals (pets) etc. This was then converted into a streaming data format and sent to cloud with approximate latitude and longitude values as provided by the vendor based on the camera&amp;rsquo;s location and field of view. These lat-lon values were then converted into cartesian coordinates, effectively treating Bryant park in a 2D plane for getting the data ready for digital twin studies. We also created a few zones and mapped the coordinates accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion to cartesian coordinates helped us to map the pedestrian movement patterns in the field of view. Additionally, we also extracted other information to answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are passing through our zones in the park?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long are people generally in the park for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are sitting in the park?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are walking babies/strollers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many tourists/suitcases ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are people riding bikes in the park?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many deliveries with carts are made?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are walking pets in the park?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people per hour, walking speed, which way are they going,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What % of people are stopping?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to run analytics on the video feed and the derived variables. Also, we were able to generate a digital twin using the converted coordinates. This helped us build capability for any future projects that might entail the use of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
