      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a voluntary project under the Aeromodelling Club in the summer holidays from May 2016 to July 2016. The aim of the project was to train a team to build a composite glider as well as try a new kind of HLG glider, the Allegro 2m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the composite glider &amp;ldquo;Allegro 2m&amp;rdquo; was chosen for this project. The different airfoils were directly obtained from Prof. Mark Drela&amp;rsquo;s page and templates were cut using laser cutter. These templates were then used to cut the foam which would form the base of the wings / tails using a gravity hot wire cutter. These foam cuttings were then covered with an optimal number of glass fibre and carbon fibre sheets for providing it hte strength it needs. The optimum layers were calculated by designing a MATLAB code to take into account shear stress at different locations of the wing while in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contary to the previous glider that was developed, this glider was also polyhedral but there was no dihedral in the middle and there were 2 angles on each side totalling 4 dihedrals. This ensured much better construction as giving a dihedral in the middle is very tricky. These were carefully built to maintian the same angle to ensure roll stability. The hollow fuselage was developed from the previously developed moulds. The hollow tail was built using cross arranged rolled carbon fibre cloth. Lastly, the wings and tails were spray painted and then all of the components were assembled together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project created a trend of using composite materials for fabrication in the Club paving way for future projects like &amp;ldquo;Composite Flying Wing&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33&#34;&gt;We achieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;$3^{rd}$ rank&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33&#34;&gt;among the 105 teams that participated from different technical institutions from all across India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROBOCON is an Asia-Pacific robotics competition held every year with different problem statements. The problem statements are carefully curated to encourage design innovations in the field of robotics. The theme of the competition for the year 2016 was &amp;ldquo;Clean Energy recharging of world&amp;rdquo;. The problem statement was to make 2 robots, one being a powered robot and the other being a non-powered robot that will move using non-contact forces provided by the former. The aim was to make the non-powered robot travel on a path with elevation, curves, sharp turns etc autonomously using line following. This bot was carrying a lightweight fan. The other robot, in addition to providing the required force for the non-powered robot to move, had to collect the aforementioned fan from the non-powered robot after it had covered the entire stretch, climb a pole and then place the fan on the top of the pole. This would mark the completion (&amp;ldquo;Chai-Yo&amp;rdquo; as they called it) of the challenge and the team that achieves this first would win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the leaders in the 21 member team that took part in the competition represting my alma mater, IIT Kanpur. We worked on this from October 2015 to March 2016. We managed to achieve  that participated from different technical institutions from all across India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to go with wind as the mode of force to move the non-powered robot. We used a propellor fan to generate the wind and a styrofoam sail was attached to the non-powered robot to catch the wind and propel it forward. This bot was made using lightweight balse wood and glass fibre which have an impressive strenght-to-weight ratio. We further designed the truss patterns on the wood and got it cut by laser to have the lightest possible bot. We also employed line tracking on the bot to follow the required path. These prototypes were first designed on Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks and then cut and assembled using precise machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powered bot had an autonomous climbing mechanism using rubberised clamp wheels. To follow the path and align itself to the pole, it used wall following to follow the arena wall. We were consistently able to achieve &amp;ldquo;Chai-Yo&amp;rdquo; in about 50 seconds of runtime (You can take a look at the video which has the complete run while we were still preparing for the competition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time that composite materials were being used in the Aeromodelling Club, IIT Kanpur. This project opened up a whole array of opportunities for the club to divest into composite construction of other designs including flying wings, UAVs etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was done as a part of the summer project offering from Robotics Club, IIT Kanpur. The aim of this project was to build an all-terrain robot capable of autonomous navigation and provide surveillance in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We modelled the robot on Solidworks and machined it using aluminium and CNC machines. For navigation, we integrated the IMU sensor with the GPS anc coupled them together iwth a Kalman filter. Also, we imported Google Maps API for setting the route to be travelled and later converted the route into different waypoints to be followed. This waypoint file was uploaded to the robot&amp;rsquo;s APM (mission planner).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33&#34;&gt;We achieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;$11^{th}$ rank&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#33cc33&#34;&gt;among the 80 teams that participated from different technical institutions from all across India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROBOCON is an Asia-Pacific robotics competition held every year with different problem statements. The problem statements are carefully curated to encourage design innovations in the field of robotics. The problem statement for the year 2015 was to make 2 robots that will play a doubles badminton match with the other team&amp;rsquo;s robots. The choice of fully automated vs manual robots was provided by the organisers. I was a part of the 21 member team that took part in the competition represting my alma mater, IIT Kanpur. We worked on this from October 2014 to March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 bots designed were capable of serving the shuttle cock across the net to land in a specific region designated as a &amp;lsquo;successful serve&amp;rsquo; by the organisers. They also had mechanisms to return the serve of the opposing team using different placements of badminton racquets. The image shows one of our robots that had a double pneumatic actuation mechanism in the center alongwith 2 side racquets to return the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a part of the electronics team, managing the power delivery to the different components of the bot. Also, to reduce the clutter of wires, I designed Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) of different components of the bot, eg. the motor driver, on Altium Designer and got them printed for use. I also had major contributions in designing the mechanism to serve the shuttlecock.&lt;/p&gt;
