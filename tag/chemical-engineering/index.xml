      <title>Complete Plant Design of Acrylic Acid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a course project for Chemical Desgin course under Prof. Nitin Kaistha. The aim of the project was to design a chemical plant from scratch for the production of acrylic acid. The design should be optimal with respect to the different costs associated with the production and it should be robust to input stream fluctuations. This was a rather interesting project as it brought together everything that we learned in the span of 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was meticulously thought of by theoretical knowledge and the whole plant was simulated using ASPEN HYSYS package. The simulations were done both for the equilibrium stage of the plant as well as for the dynamics with controllers attached to several parts of the components, as can be seen in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macroscopic model for Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/transdermal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was part of my internship at TATA Research Design and Development Centre. The internship started May 2017 and ended July 2017. The objective of the project was to develop a macroscopic model of skin’s upper layer stratum corneum using OpenFoam, an open-source library. This library was chosen as this provided and open source FVM alternative to the licensed FEM solver, COMSOL. Apart from that, nobody in the firm had used it before, so it served as an exploration study into using this library. However, as I was able to finish the objective early, I also finished an extension of the project, which included studying the effects of electroporation on the drug transfer kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task was to get used to the OpenFOAM library which is completely CLI based. After getting a handle of the different methods and way of working, the first model was developed of the uppermost skin layer, Stratum Corneum using a parameterised brick and mortar structure. This model was then used to model a transdermal drug delivery by Fickian diffusion through the layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl and Caffeine were chosen to be studied based on literature review and their scope of usage in transdermal delivery. The diffusion coefficients for these components were obtained from MD simulations. Running them through the developed model provided drug release profiles for both. These profiles were validated by experimental studies present in literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, there were a lot of files that needed to be modified to set up an OpenFOAM simulation, running iterations while maintaining correctness (not missing editing a file) was a steep task. Hence, I worked on automating the whole simulation process and file editing structure using C++ and Bash. This reduced simulation set up times drastically allowing me to run several iterations and complete the objective of my internship way before my internship end date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I was able to extend the study to include the effects of electroporation on the drug delivery profiles. The new model developed with electroporation was again validated with experimental data and was found to be in good agreement. Also, the drug release significantly increased after using electroporation which was expected from the study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Numerical Study of SiO2 Burner profiles</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/burnerprofile/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an Undergraduate project under Prof. Naveen Tiwari, Prof. V Shankar and Prof. Goutam Deo from January 2017 to March 2017. The aim of the study was to model an SiO2 burner with specific dimensions and study the temperature profiles of the burner. The project also included studiyng the distribution of different species present at different distances away from the flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick off the modelling, adiabatic flame temperature was calculated for a hydrogen-oxygen combustion process. The equilibrium analysis was done on ASPEN Plus package. To validate the results, the same value was cross-referenced with literature values. It was found to be in good agreement with that. Next, a 100% conversion analysis was done using the same suite. However, this time the same model was built using first principles on MATLAB and the results were compared. Again, there was a very good agreement with both of these values. Hence, we concluded that the modelling process done in the ASPEN Plus suite is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having validated our model, we started experimenting with different conditions for the same process. This included changing the temperature as well as adding Silicon Tetrachloride in the feed. Finally, a dependence between the hydrogen flow rate with the adiabatic temperature was established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we moved on to the kinetics of the problem. The overall reaction was broken down into several different intermediate reactions. Every one of these intermediate reactions have different kinetic parameters. All the possible intermediate reactions were written and validated with theroy and literature. Preliminary reaction kinetics were performed with an assumed value of burner diameter and were qualitatively checked with literature values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the original burner dimensions were added to the model and all the calculations were re-run for this. The mole fractions of the different species were studied at the end of the flame. This provided much better view into the temperature variation in the flame and the different reaction progress with the length of the flame. This gave us the minimum length of the flame to ensure that the reaction gets over and a maximum conversion of raw materials to products can be achieved with minimal waste.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Nanoparticle Precipitation in Y-Mixers</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/ymixer/</link>

      <guid>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/ymixer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an Undergraduate project under Prof. Nishith Verma which went on from March 2016 to December 2016. Our aim was to perform an investigation into the particle densities obtained by mixing two fluids in a Y-shaped mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the y mixer model was generated in C++ in 2 and later 3 dimensions and simulations were run using the Lattice Boltzmann method. This resulted in fluid flow diagrams which were matched with experiments. After validating this model, tracer analysis was done on the outputs. This ensured us to capture the cross section and the mixing capabilities of the mixer. This was again validated from experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a C++ lattice boltzmann model ready, we moved on to using the palabos library to include population balance equations in our simulation model. This included the new calculations as well as sped up the entire code by about 40%. Nucleation rates and growth rates for the different particles were provided based on experimental chemical reactions and the population density of the product was studied at different cross sections of the mixer representing varying mixer sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PID Characteristics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a part of the Unit Operations Lab course. The aim of this project was to innovate and go above and beyond the standard lab experiments with the same equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We modelled the whole process in MATLAB Simulink deriving transfer functions from experimental data. Also, we took the default PID values present in the controller on the setup and tuned those values. We found that the response received is much better than the default response recorded. Hence, we submitted the parameters to be updated in the controller for more accurate experiments thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Centrifugal Pump Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/innovationlabpump/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a part of the Unit Operations Lab course. The aim of this project was to innovate and go above and beyond the standard lab experiments with the same equipment. We were assigned the centrifugal pump setup which is originally used to study the effect of series and parallel setup of pumps on the discharge pressure and flow rate. We however decided to perform a very different study using the same equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our experiments, we noticed that there was a measurable gap between turning up the RPM of the motor and actually observing differences in the flow rate. This lead us to believe that there is some sort of a lag in play between the inputs and outputs. To model this lag, we assumed first order dynamics for simplicity and calculated the transfer function of the pump ny oberving the time difference it takes to reach equilibrium after giving the input. We later tested this obtained transfer function by further experimenting with the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure utmost accuracy in our calculation, we used high FPS cameras to record readings when we were giving a small step change as an input to the motor (change of RPM). We also performed an opimisation study for an optimum RPM for the motor for best energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
