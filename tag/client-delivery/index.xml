      <title>Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to switch from legacy contract management tool to a new vendor. However, they were not confident of the metadata they had for the contracts and wanted help in getting all the major information extracted from the documents. They also wanted hierarchical linkages for most of the contracts for better organisation in the new tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We solved the first problem with a myriad of different tools. These included advanced NLP models for entity extraction based on transformers, tree based ML models for certain classifications and logic-driven string search models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common fields that are present in almost every document were extracted using a trained NER model linked with an active learning pipeline. These models were built using a modified version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/princeton-nlp/PURE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PURE&lt;/a&gt;, an open source offering by Princeton NLP. The active learning pipeline was built using LabelStudio as a frontend for manual annotations to get initial training data and then subsequently, for getting labels for the most uncertain samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fields which had only a few possible values like &amp;ldquo;Agreement Type&amp;rdquo;, were trained using a simple Random Forest classifier. The training data was obhtained using a mix of string extractions from the filenames and the existing contract metadata provided by the client. This, combined with the NER model resulted in boosted accuracies for this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built logic-based string search models for those fields which were not abundantly present and were more situational. These included fields like &amp;ldquo;Force Majeure&amp;rdquo; and all fields associated with this, &amp;ldquo;Termination Payments&amp;rdquo;, etc. This helped us extract information for these fields for the majority of the documents they were present in with little overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these extractions were provided to the client and after spot-checking and QA, were used in the construction of hierarchical linkages. Strong linkages were built by extracting the reference phrase within contracts that contains the details regarding the parent or the child contract. These were then translated back to the database we had. Weak linkages were also built based off of logic to combine documents under each MSA umbrella wherever the extraction of the reference phrase wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extractions provided to the client passed the QA test with about 90% accuracy. Also, we managed to provide hierchical linkages for more than 75% of the documents provided to us that could be linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has historically been a manual-only job with several hours of manpower invested in reading through the huge contracts and extracting information. We accelerated this process by appending this with models wherever possible. This reduced the load on the manual annotators and we were able to complete this in a fraction of the time that would&amp;rsquo;ve been invested in an all-manual project &lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold&#34;&gt;saving roughly 30,000 hours and $750,000 for the client&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to prepare for and ensure a safe transitioning of people from &amp;ldquo;Work from home&amp;rdquo; to Office space. They wanted to make sure that the facility should be used responsibly and at no time there should be breaches of the social distancing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-solution-architecture&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Solution Architecture
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prepared a solution that gave the client the ability to track and measure the occupancy and social distancing norms anonymously. We set up a LIDAR in the client office space attached with a hub to send the data to the cloud. Several calculations and checks were performed on the cloud and the final data was sent to the dashboard. The real time occupancy readings (both overall and zone-based) were also visualised by the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of our solution, the client could monitor occupancy in real-time, track occupancy trends and monitor the hotspots in the office. As an extension, this can further be used to optimise the office space usage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Factory Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/factoryintelligence/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/factoryintelligence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our client was facing unplanned machine downtimes in their factories. Obtaining insights from machinery on factory floors is time-consuming, complex, and costly due to legacy infrastructure and bespoke systems that cannot be easily accessed. Accelerating the time it takes to draw intelligence from machine data is critical to get an accurate pulse on manufacturing operations. While many vendors offer comprehensive IIoT solutions, we were looking for quicker and more cost-effective alternatives to deploying a sophisticated end-to-end platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-solution-architecture&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;
        &lt;img alt=&#34;Solution Architecture&#34; srcset=&#34;

               /project/factoryintelligence/architecture_huf2eca023e3a5b6f297102972273e9a3e_1060700_0e2693532b5456e754cbd13354aeb822.png 760w,
               /project/factoryintelligence/architecture_huf2eca023e3a5b6f297102972273e9a3e_1060700_1200x1200_fit_lanczos_3.png 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/factoryintelligence/architecture_huf2eca023e3a5b6f297102972273e9a3e_1060700_ebf303ea2be1037a783bdc8fcd762a18.png&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;508&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable class=&#34; img-light&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Solution Architecture
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed, deployed and tested a fully-functioning prototype on our clientâs manufacturing floor in less than 4 weeks. Our solution utilized low-cost vibration sensors and accelerometers connected directly to selected machines. These sensors captured near real-time data and provided rapid analytics by bypassing timely integrations with existing factory systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also designed and built a customized dashboard offering a simple and elegant view of the captured insights. The insights present on the dashboard included machine schedules, unplanned downtimes, overall availability and the number of times the machine was stopped. All of this was reported and updated real-time with a resolution of 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of spending months and significant budget to deploy an end-to-end IIoT platform, our client was equipped with critical insights in a much shorter timeframe. KPIs captured included machine up/downtime compared with scheduled operating times. The intelligence gathered not only provided efficiency gains and cost savings, but also avoided our client complex work orders to deploy sensory equipment. Consequently, client involvement was low-touch and the manufacturing process was not interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-country Asset Tracking</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/assettracking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client were facing problems with cargo damage while in transit which were resulting in huge losses for them. Also, since the transit included multiple contractors responsible for different stretches of the overall route, and nobody was taking responsibility for the damages, they were at a loss and had no idea how to rectify this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;326&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable class=&#34; img-light&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Solution Architecture
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created an end-to-end asset tracking system for the client. The clients were given low-cost devices housing different sensors to include them with their shipments. These devices were very small (about 2cm x 2cm x 1cm) and were tested for harsh weather. Also, these devices were equipped with a battery, a GPS and cellular communication technology along with the accelerometer, humidity and temperature sensors. These were configured to be used as one time use devices to save on device recovery costs / logistics. They were configured to report information all along the journey and last the whole shipment time without the need of a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thresholding was done on the accelerometer sensor housed in the device to store high impacts faced by it, which would directly correlate with the damage faced the equipment. These raw accelerometer values were then configured to be sent to the cloud managed by the manufacturer. This data was then available to be used using simple API requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw data collection and conversion to impact system was built on an application enablement platform. This resulted in quick prototyping and testing of the proof of concept. The processed data was then sent to a live dahsboard which was shared with the client for their perusal. This dashboard offered several important metrics such as the last known location, temperature and battery of the device. It also showed the impact values versus timestamp which were recorded by the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From using this solution, we were able to ascertain different impact values faced by the device during different portions of the journey. This helped the client to visualise and piece together possible regions where the shipment was getting damaged. Our analysis found that most of the impacts registered by the device were when the device was travelling from the factory to the ports, which was contrary to the earlier belief of the client that most of the damage was being caused during the ship route. This allowed the client to focus on that section and helped them save a lot of revenue spent on replacing damaged products as well as save the reputation of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Damaged Car Parts Segmentation for auto claims</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/carpartsegmentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/carpartsegmentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to reduce the time spent by their employees in looking through several different photographs submitted for insurance claims clearing and ascertain damaged parts of the vehicle with the extent of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We solved the problem by training a semantic segmentation model used for ascertainining the different kinds of damage that were present in the photograph of a vehicle (like the figure attached). To ensure the correctness of the model, we also employed an explainable AI technique, LIME, which returned the parts of the image it is looking at when coming to a decision about the damage of a particular type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few classification models were also trained to fetch images which were visually similar with the current image. The different variants were the similar damage model, where the model would return the top images which have visually similar damage to the current image. The other variant was the similar non-damage model, in which the model would return the top images of similar vehicles of previously processed claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, an automated report generation tool was coupled with the model (using FPDF), which returned a formatted PDF report having detailed information regarding the damage and the claims (a sample report attached).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;mt-1&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segmentation model ensured that the client team spent lesser time on figuring out the damage and more time providing personalised support to the consumers. The classification models helped the client team to look at some previous claims to decide the outcome for the current claim in a more informed and consistent manner. This improved the overall reputation of the firm in disbursing out claims. Also, the automated report could be handed over to the consumers directly for a much more transparent view into the claims processing.&lt;/p&gt;
