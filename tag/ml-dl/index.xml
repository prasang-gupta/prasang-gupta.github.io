      <title>Demand Prediction with Competition Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to predict consumer demand using data from competition and infusing it with other datasets that influence demand like mobility and demographic variables. The other goal was to correct a proprietary mobility dataset used by PwC to incorporate for mobility changes brought on by COVID restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietary dataset mentioned had several flaws including data inconsistencies over months and years and noisy data which was not helping in developing stable models. It also didn&amp;rsquo;t account for any socio-economic variables based on the demographics of the region. To correct this, the proprietary dataset was merged with demographics variables based on the location and some feature engineering was done to get the mobility in radii of 1km to 5km based on the store location. The final sales value was kept as the dependent field for the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple model architectures were tried to model this information to correct the mobility, including ML and DL models. Finally, a voting ensemble method was selected which was modelling the corrected demand with an accuracy of about 70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bump up the numbers further, an aerial snapshot of the region around the score was obtained from Google Satellite API at a tuned zoom level and a segmentation exercise was performed on the image to extract the type of region around the store. This was expected to bring another dimension of immediate demographics in the dataset. This was done by extracting the coverage area of different colors based on pixel masks :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grey (signifying roads, parking lots, streets, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green (signifying agriculture, parks, vegetation, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White (signifying roof-tops, buildings, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final model with all the variables included (engineered visits from proprietary data, Google mobility data, demographics data and derived immediate demographics of the store from satellite images) achieved a test accuracy of 75%. This improved the quality of the mobility data and impacted tens of projects that utilised this mobility dataset helping in building much more accurate and robust models for client deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/activelearning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to build out a pipeline for active learning that other projects with scarce labelled data will leverage for model building. It also included trying the effectiveness of active learning on a standard dataset and evaluate different techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset chosen for this study was CIFAR10. This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 images with 10 unique classes. We used a maximum of 10,000 images at each time for training purposes. This study&amp;rsquo;s focus was to compare the performance of active and passive learning using same number of labelled samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passive learning model would be trained on a uniform distribution of the dataset size, however, the active learning model would be initialised with half the training size and then would be trained for the full size by sequential queries. We tried 3 queries in this study : uncertainty, margin sampling and entropy sampling. We achieved better performance with active learning for all the sizes, however, the improvement in performance varied from as low as 1% to a sizable 23%. The details for all the experiments and the queries can be seen in the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline developed from this project was consecutively used in multiple client projects to improve the modelling capabilities and thrive wherever manually labelling the full dataset was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Damaged Car Parts Segmentation for auto claims</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/carpartsegmentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to reduce the time spent by their employees in looking through several different photographs submitted for insurance claims clearing and ascertain damaged parts of the vehicle with the extent of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We solved the problem by training a semantic segmentation model used for ascertainining the different kinds of damage that were present in the photograph of a vehicle (like the figure attached). To ensure the correctness of the model, we also employed an explainable AI technique, LIME, which returned the parts of the image it is looking at when coming to a decision about the damage of a particular type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few classification models were also trained to fetch images which were visually similar with the current image. The different variants were the similar damage model, where the model would return the top images which have visually similar damage to the current image. The other variant was the similar non-damage model, in which the model would return the top images of similar vehicles of previously processed claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, an automated report generation tool was coupled with the model (using FPDF), which returned a formatted PDF report having detailed information regarding the damage and the claims (a sample report attached).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;IMPACT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segmentation model ensured that the client team spent lesser time on figuring out the damage and more time providing personalised support to the consumers. The classification models helped the client team to look at some previous claims to decide the outcome for the current claim in a more informed and consistent manner. This improved the overall reputation of the firm in disbursing out claims. Also, the automated report could be handed over to the consumers directly for a much more transparent view into the claims processing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementation of Live models on Edge</title>
      <link>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/edgelivemodels/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/edgelivemodels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project was two fold. The first aim was to implement an action recognition model and the second was to modify it to run on an edge device. For this, we chose the Pre-trained Temporal Relation Network Model. The dataset chosen for this was the 20BN-something-something Dataset V2. This dataset has over 100 classes of different object-human or object-object interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;jetson.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jetson TX2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#5DADE2;font-style:bold;font-size:120%&#34;&gt;DETAILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model was first implemented on a laptop with the webcam and then later extended onto the edge device, Jetson TX2. Prior to this, the TX2 was flashed and proper libraries were built from source to enable it to use its full potential (CUDA cores for rendering). We were successfully able to implement this on the board and were getting very respectable frame rates, somewhere around 10 fps. The performance of this model for several different scenarios can be seen in the videos link and a little detail about the implementation can be found in the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, we also implemented simple object detection models on Raspberry Pi on which we were getting around 1-2 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
