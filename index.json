Obtaining insights from machinery on factory floors is time-consuming, complex, and costly due to legacy infrastructure and bespoke systems that cannot be easily accessed. Accelerating the time it takes to draw intelligence from machine data is critical to get an accurate pulse on manufacturing operations. While many vendors offer comprehensive IIoT solutions, we were looking for quicker and more cost-effective alternatives to deploying a sophisticated end-to-end platform.\nOUR SOLUTION We designed, deployed and tested a fully-functioning prototype on our client‚Äôs manufacturing floor in less than 4 weeks. Our solution utilized low-cost vibration sensors and accelerometers connected directly to selected machines. These sensors captured near real-time data and provided rapid analytics by bypassing timely integrations with existing factory systems.\nWe also designed and built a customized dashboard offering a simple and elegant view of the captured insights. The insights present on the dashboard included machine schedules, unplanned downtimes, overall availability and the number of times the machine was stopped. All of this was reported and updated real-time with a resolution of 4 minutes.\nVALUE GENERATED Instead of spending months and significant budget to deploy an end-to-end IIoT platform, our client was equipped with critical insights in a much shorter timeframe. KPIs captured included machine up/downtime compared with scheduled operating times. The intelligence gathered not only provided efficiency gains and cost savings, but also avoided our client complex work orders to deploy sensory equipment.

Also, since the transit included multiple contractors responsible for different stretches of the overall route, and nobody was taking responsibility for the damages, they were at a loss and had no idea how to rectify this.\nOUR SOLUTION We created an end-to-end asset tracking system for the client. The clients were given low-cost devices housing different sensors to include them with their shipments. These devices were very small (about 2cm x 2cm x 1cm) and were tested for harsh weather. Also, these devices were equipped with a battery, a GPS and cellular communication technology along with the accelerometer, humidity and temperature sensors. These were configured to be used as one time use devices to save on device recovery costs / logistics. They were configured to report information all along the journey and last the whole shipment time without the need of a recharge.\nThresholding was done on the accelerometer sensor housed in the device to store high impacts faced by it, which would directly correlate with the damage faced the equipment. These raw accelerometer values were then configured to be sent to the cloud managed by the manufacturer. This data was then available to be used using simple API requests.\nThe raw data collection and conversion to impact system was built on an application enablement platform. This resulted in quick prototyping and testing of the proof of concept. The processed data was then sent to a live dahsboard which was shared with the client for their perusal. This dashboard offered several important metrics such as the last known location, temperature and battery of the device. It also showed the impact values versus timestamp which were recorded by the device.\nVALUE GENERATED From using this solution, we were able to ascertain different impact values faced by the device during different portions of the journey. This helped the client to visualise and piece together possible regions where the shipment was getting damaged. Our analysis found that most of the impacts registered by the device were when the device was travelling from the factory to the ports, which was contrary to the earlier belief of the client that most of the damage was being caused during the ship route. This allowed the client to focus on that section and helped them save a lot of revenue spent on replacing damaged products as well as save the reputation of the company.\n","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"a5a2fcfbae6947872820b3e442812000","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/assettracking/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/assettracking/","section":"project","summary":"Tracked cargo shipment using cost-effective sensors along its journey from factory to distribution center (between countries with road and water route) ascertaining possible locations of damage","tags":["IoT","Asset Tracking","Cost-effective sensors"],"title":"Cross-country Asset Tracking","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The aim of this project was two fold.

To ensure the correctness of the model, we also employed an explainable AI technique, LIME, which returns the parts of the image it is looking at when coming to a decision about the damage.\nA few classification models were also trained to fetch images which were visually similar with the current image. The different variants were the similar damage model, where the model would return the top images which have visually similar damage to the current image. The other variant was the similar non-damage model, in which the model would return the top images of similar vehicles of previously processed claims.\nTo top it all off, an automated report generation tool was coupled with the model (using FPDF), which returned a formatted PDF report having detailed information regarding the damage and the claims.\nVALUE GENERATED The segmentation model ensured that the client team spent lesser time on figuring out the damage and more time providing personalised support to the consumers. The classification models helped the client team to look at some previous claims to decide the outcome for the current claim in a more informed and consistent manner. This improved the overall reputation of the firm in disbursing out claims. Also, the automated report could be handed over to the consumers directly for a much more transparent view into the claims processing.\n","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"47148c388f41cabf2e022c8374cce312","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/carpartsegmentation/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/carpartsegmentation/","section":"project","summary":"Performed damanged car parts segmentation for automating auto claims with additional features like explainability and automated claim / damage report generation","tags":["Deep Learning","Semantic segmentation","Classification","Auto insurance","AI assisted claims"],"title":"Damaged Car Parts Segmentation for auto claims","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was a course project for Chemical Desgin course under Prof. Nitin Kaistha.

The internship started May 2017 and ended July 2017. The objective of the project was to develop a macroscopic model of skin‚Äôs upper layer stratum corneum using OpenFoam, an open-source library. This library was chosen as this provided and open source FVM alternative to the licensed FEM solver, COMSOL. Apart from that, nobody in the firm had used it before, so it served as an exploration study into using this library. However, as I was able to finish the objective early, I also finished an extension of the project, which included studying the effects of electroporation on the drug transfer kinetics.\nThe first task was to get used to the OpenFOAM library which is completely CLI based. After getting a handle of the different methods and way of working, the first model was developed of the uppermost skin layer, Stratum Corneum using a parameterised brick and mortar structure. This model was then used to model a transdermal drug delivery by Fickian diffusion through the layer.\nFentanyl and Caffeine were chosen to be studied based on literature review and their scope of usage in transdermal delivery. The diffusion coefficients for these components were obtained from MD simulations. Running them through the developed model provided drug release profiles for both. These profiles were validated by experimental studies present in literature.\nSince, there were a lot of files that needed to be modified to set up an OpenFOAM simulation, running iterations while maintaining correctness (not missing editing a file) was a steep task. Hence, I worked on automating the whole simulation process and file editing structure using C++ and Bash. This reduced simulation set up times drastically allowing me to run several iterations and complete the objective of my internship way before my internship end date.\nAs a result, I was able to extend the study to include the effects of electroporation on the drug delivery profiles. The new model developed with electroporation was again validated with experimental data and was found to be in good agreement. Also, the drug release significantly increased after using electroporation which was expected from the study.\n","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"065865e70f080dfc2cb70a483d61ac37","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/transdermal/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/transdermal/","section":"project","summary":"Developed a macroscopic model of skin's upper layer (Stratum Corneum) to study transdermal drug delivery and effectiveness of electroporation on drug transfer.","tags":["Chemical Engineering","Transdermal Drug Delivery","Electroporation","Skin modelling","OpenFOAM","C++"],"title":"Macroscopic model for Transdermal Drug Delivery","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was an Undergraduate project under Prof. Naveen Tiwari, Prof. V Shankar and Prof. Goutam Deo from January 2017 to March 2017. The aim of the study was to model an SiO2 burner with specific dimensions and study the temperature profiles of the burner. The project also included studiyng the distribution of different species present at different distances away from the flame.\nTo kick off the modelling, adiabatic flame temperature was calculated for a hydrogen-oxygen combustion process. The equilibrium analysis was done on ASPEN Plus package. To validate the results, the same value was cross-referenced with literature values. It was found to be in good agreement with that. Next, a 100% conversion analysis was done using the same suite. However, this time the same model was built using first principles on MATLAB and the results were compared. Again, there was a very good agreement with both of these values. Hence, we concluded that the modelling process done in the ASPEN Plus suite is correct.\nHaving validated our model, we started experimenting with different conditions for the same process. This included changing the temperature as well as adding Silicon Tetrachloride in the feed. Finally, a dependence between the hydrogen flow rate with the adiabatic temperature was established.\nNext, we moved on to the kinetics of the problem. The overall reaction was broken down into several different intermediate reactions. Every one of these intermediate reactions have different kinetic parameters. All the possible intermediate reactions were written and validated with theroy and literature. Preliminary reaction kinetics were performed with an assumed value of burner diameter and were qualitatively checked with literature values.\nFurther, the original burner dimensions were added to the model and all the calculations were re-run for this. The mole fractions of the different species were studied at the end of the flame. This provided much better view into the temperature variation in the flame and the different reaction progress with the length of the flame. This gave us the minimum length of the flame to ensure that the reaction gets over and a maximum conversion of raw materials to products can be achieved with minimal waste.\n","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"52259abf97ccb4a6e46c9408e9cced1b","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/burnerprofile/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/burnerprofile/","section":"project","summary":"Performed a numerical study of SiO2 burner profiles simulating a burner flame and calculating the flame temperature profile and species distribution in the flame.","tags":["Chemical Engineering","Burner profile","Adiabatic Temperature Calculation","MATLAB","COMSOL","ANSYS Chemkin","ASPEN Plus"],"title":"Numerical Study of SiO2 Burner profiles","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was an Undergraduate project under Prof. Nishith Verma which went on from March 2016 to December 2016.

The different airfoils were directly obtained from Prof. Mark Drela\u0026rsquo;s page and templates were cut using laser cutter. These templates were then used to cut the foam which would form the base of the wings / tails using a gravity hot wire cutter. These foam cuttings were then covered with an optimal number of glass fibre and carbon fibre sheets for providing it hte strength it needs. The optimum layers were calculated by designing a MATLAB code to take into account shear stress at different locations of the wing while in flight.\nContary to the previous glider that was developed, this glider was also polyhedral but there was no dihedral in the middle and there were 2 angles on each side totalling 4 dihedrals. This ensured much better construction as giving a dihedral in the middle is very tricky. These were carefully built to maintian the same angle to ensure roll stability. The hollow fuselage was developed from the previously developed moulds. The hollow tail was built using cross arranged rolled carbon fibre cloth. Lastly, the wings and tails were spray painted and then all of the components were assembled together.\n","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"f7791778554f29edbadf61ad83634be6","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/glidermentor/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/glidermentor/","section":"project","summary":"Mentored and led a team of 5 people to fabricate Prof. Mark Drela's Allegro glider (Hand Launch Glider) with a 2m wingspan","tags":["Aeromodelling","HLG (Hand Launch Gliders)","Composite glider","XFLR"],"title":"Composite Allegro 2m glider","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was a part of the Unit Operations Lab course. The aim of this project was to innovate and go above and beyond the standard lab experiments with the same equipment. We were assigned the centrifugal pump setup which is originally used to study the effect of series and parallel setup of pumps on the discharge pressure and flow rate. We however decided to perform a very different study using the same equipment.\nDuring our experiments, we noticed that there was a measurable gap between turning up the RPM of the motor and actually observing differences in the flow rate. This lead us to believe that there is some sort of a lag in play between the inputs and outputs. To model this lag, we assumed first order dynamics for simplicity and calculated the transfer function of the pump ny oberving the time difference it takes to reach equilibrium after giving the input. We later tested this obtained transfer function by further experimenting with the setup.\nTo ensure utmost accuracy in our calculation, we used high FPS cameras to record readings when we were giving a small step change as an input to the motor (change of RPM). We also performed an opimisation study for an optimum RPM for the motor for best energy efficiency.\n","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"5539ee4f363e92280dbed44384db1dcc","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/innovationlabpump/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/innovationlabpump/","section":"project","summary":"Studied the control characteristics of the centrifugal pump system.

The problem statements are carefully curated to encourage design innovations in the field of robotics. The theme of the competition for the year 2016 was \u0026ldquo;Clean Energy recharging of world\u0026rdquo;. The problem statement was to make 2 robots, one being a powered robot and the other being a non-powered robot that will move using non-contact forces provided by the former. The aim was to make the non-powered robot travel on a path with elevation, curves, sharp turns etc autonomously using line following. This bot was carrying a lightweight fan. The other robot, in addition to providing the required force for the non-powered robot to move, had to collect the aforementioned fan from the non-powered robot after it had covered the entire stretch, climb a pole and then place the fan on the top of the pole. This would mark the completion (\u0026ldquo;Chai-Yo\u0026rdquo; as they called it) of the challenge and the team that achieves this first would win.\nI was one of the leaders in the 21 member team that took part in the competition represting my alma mater, IIT Kanpur. We worked on this from October 2015 to March 2016. We managed to achieve 3rd rank amongst the 105 teams that participated from different technical institutions from all across India.\nWe chose to go with wind as the mode of force to move the non-powered robot. We used a propellor fan to generate the wind and a styrofoam sail was attached to the non-powered robot to catch the wind and propel it forward. This bot was made using lightweight balse wood and glass fibre which have an impressive strenght-to-weight ratio. We further designed the truss patterns on the wood and got it cut by laser to have the lightest possible bot. We also employed line tracking on the bot to follow the required path. These prototypes were first designed on Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks and then cut and assembled using precise machinery.\nThe powered bot had an autonomous climbing mechanism using rubberised clamp wheels. To follow the path and align itself to the pole, it used wall following to follow the arena wall. We were consistently able to achieve \u0026ldquo;Chai-Yo\u0026rdquo; in about 50 seconds of runtime (You can take a look at the video which has the complete run while we were still preparing for the competition).\n","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"4ea3cf7e5a8663511adae3ca8118c1e5","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/robocon16/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/robocon16/","section":"project","summary":"Designed 2 robots as a part of the ABU ROBOCON 2016 challenge, one being a powered robot and the other being a non-powered robot that will move using non-contact forces provided by the former and steer using line following.
