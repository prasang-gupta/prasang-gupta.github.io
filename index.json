The tradeoff with accuracy was accepted in favour of time. We tested different models, the most popular being YourTTS, SCGlowTTS and SV2TTS. On the basis of qualitative assessment on the representative test dataset, which included both male and female audio samples in 3 different accents (American, British and Indian), YourTTS model was selected as the clear winner.\nAfter finalising the model, this was tested further for robustness and a minimum sample audio time was estimated based off of these tests and it came out to be 1 minute for getting decent results in most cases. We then deployed this solution on an internal hosting site and created an interactive demo using our developed model as the backend. A representative set of 10 small sentences were obtained which contain as many different phonetics as possible and then a feature was added to record the user speak these sentences.\nAfter running these samples through the model, which takes about a minute, the user would be able to hear their deepfake speaking 5 different sentences that were not a part of the representative set in their voice.\n","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"23814bf7634f7bbd4b79b08a59e5c71b","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/deepfakeaudio/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deepfakeaudio/","section":"project","summary":"Created a web-hosted demo to generate audio from text in the voice of the user with a voice sample size of barely 1 minute using a zero-shot audio generation model","tags":["Zero-Shot","Deepfake","Deep Learning","Audio Generation","Text to Speech","Demo","Proof of Concept","ML-DL"],"title":"Zero-Shot Deepfake Generation - Audio","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"AIM\nThe aim of this project was to create a solution that can be used to train a model that can be split into multiple pieces and can be run in parallel on multiple separate devices.\nDETAILS\nThe architecture used was the recently published DeCNN (Decoupled CNN) network. The authors had used GConv with Channel Shuffle and added other network and OS level modifications to improve the performance of the decoupled architecture. For initial testing, we only focused on Scheme 1 and ignored other optimisations to establish a baseline.\nWe used the tiny imagenet dataset and Resnet-34 model for testing and comparing the standard CNN results with DeCNN. We compared based on the performance (accuracy metrics) and the time taken to run inference on a fixed batch of data. It was found that there was a performance decrease by using DeCNN as some of the information is lost while doing channel shuffling. To counter that, we used 1.5x kernels as in the standard CNN to keep the performance comparable. Even while using just the Scheme 1 mentioned above, we got about 15% bump up in inference speeds with just 2 devices.

These include the SOTA Actor-critic algorithms as well as simpler DQN based algorithms. The problem with these is that an environment needs to be setup for training them and the learning curve for these algorithms is a bit steep for someone inexperienced in the field of Reinforcement Learning.\nWe demonstrated that using Evolutionary strategies to solve episodic problems (which is getting daily purchase actions for a month in the current problem) can be a much easier and robust method. We also coupled this with a simple Neural network model to learn the patterns that are being revealed in the outputs of the ES runs. This broke down the problem into 2 mutually exclusive parts, which is much easier to understand and code.\nWe compared both qualitative and quantitative metrics for our ensemble algorithm we call GADLE with 2 traditional RL-based solutions, Actor-critic and DQN. Qualitatively, we compared the ease of writing of code and ease of understanding. Quantitatively, we ran different experiments centered around performance, sensitivity and consistency of the solutions.\nIMPACT\nThe proposed GADLE algorithm performs at par with the Actor-critic algorithm. However, it crushes the competition in terms of consistency and sensitivity.

However, they were not confident of the metadata they had for the contracts and wanted help in getting all the major information extracted from the documents. They also wanted hierarchical linkages for most of the contracts for better organisation in the new tool.\nSOLUTION\nWe solved the first problem with a myriad of different tools. These included advanced NLP models for entity extraction based on transformers, tree based ML models for certain classifications and logic-driven string search models.\nCommon fields that are present in almost every document were extracted using a trained NER model linked with an active learning pipeline. These models were built using a modified version of PURE, an open source offering by Princeton NLP. The active learning pipeline was built using LabelStudio as a frontend for manual annotations to get initial training data and then subsequently, for getting labels for the most uncertain samples.\nFields which had only a few possible values like \u0026ldquo;Agreement Type\u0026rdquo;, were trained using a simple Random Forest classifier. The training data was obhtained using a mix of string extractions from the filenames and the existing contract metadata provided by the client. This, combined with the NER model resulted in boosted accuracies for this field.\nWe built logic-based string search models for those fields which were not abundantly present and were more situational. These included fields like \u0026ldquo;Force Majeure\u0026rdquo; and all fields associated with this, \u0026ldquo;Termination Payments\u0026rdquo;, etc. This helped us extract information for these fields for the majority of the documents they were present in with little overhead.\nAll of these extractions were provided to the client and after spot-checking and QA, were used in the construction of hierarchical linkages. Strong linkages were built by extracting the reference phrase within contracts that contains the details regarding the parent or the child contract. These were then translated back to the database we had. Weak linkages were also built based off of logic to combine documents under each MSA umbrella wherever the extraction of the reference phrase wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible.\nIMPACT\nThe extractions provided to the client passed the QA test with about 90% accuracy. Also, we managed to provide hierchical linkages for more than 75% of the documents provided to us that could be linked.\nThis has historically been a manual-only job with several hours of manpower invested in reading through the huge contracts and extracting information. We accelerated this process by appending this with models wherever possible. This reduced the load on the manual annotators and we were able to complete this in a fraction of the time that would\u0026rsquo;ve been invested in an all-manual project saving roughly 30,000 hours and $750,000 for the client.\n","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"d34d2125c965f2f71d0e7147dcef6b0c","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/contractlifecyclemgmnt/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/contractlifecyclemgmnt/","section":"project","summary":"Extracted information from legacy scanned copies of contracts and built hierarchical linkages as a part of contract lifecycle management for the client","tags":["Deep Learning","Document Understanding","Information Extraction","NLP","Active Learning","Hierarchy Construction","Client Delivery","ML-DL"],"title":"Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We achieved 9th rank in the hackathon.\nAIM\nThe aim of the hackathon was to higlight bias in Twitter\u0026rsquo;s Saliency model.\nDETAILS\nTwitter\u0026rsquo;s Saliency model is a model that is used to crop over-sized images to fit on the screen representing a thumbnail preview.

It also involved testing the built system with a dummy exercise and find out the robustness of the system and any additional points that might need to be taken care of before actually attempting a client project in this domain.\nDETAILS\nWe built out a system for distributed edge compute using microk8s, a micro kubernetes engine. We paired it with metalb, a load balancer and dashboarding, resource tracking and reporting tools like grafana and prometheus. To simulate an edge environment, a local ensemble of devices was created and connected together on the same network. A total of 3 devices were included in the network including a raspbery pi, a windows laptop and an edge compute appliance. For testing out the pipeline, we ran a simple object detection model on all the devices using tensorflow serving.\nWhile testing, we also came across several limitations of the architecture. The first is that the compute power was very skewed within the networks (x86 devices were orders of magnitude faster than ARM). This lead to bottlenecking at times even with the load balancer. We also realised that running a full object detection model on small devices was not a great idea due to the compute and memory limitations of each device.\nIMPACT\nThe system built was a demonstration that multiple unused devices can be pooled together at the edge to increase the overall compute capabilities, reducing the lag of transferring data to and from the cloud. Apart from reducing latency, it also helps in keeping the data secure as everything is happening locally. This also ensures that no single edge device is overutilised hampering the pipeline.\n","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"9070eaca88ccc0748ab7d03dca8a64ef","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/distributededge/","publishdate":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/distributededge/","section":"project","summary":"Built a system capable of distributing compute across different devices on edge using load balancing and micro kubernetes engine","tags":["IoT","Distributed Compute","Compute at Edge","Proof of Concept","ML-DL"],"title":"Distributed Edge Compute","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"AIM\nThe aim of this study was to predict consumer demand using data from competition and infusing it with other datasets that influence demand like mobility and demographic variables. The other goal was to correct a proprietary mobility dataset used by PwC to incorporate for mobility changes brought on by COVID restrictions.\nDETAILS\nThe proprietary dataset mentioned had several flaws including data inconsistencies over months and years and noisy data which was not helping in developing stable models. It also didn\u0026rsquo;t account for any socio-economic variables based on the demographics of the region. To correct this, the proprietary dataset was merged with demographics variables based on the location and some feature engineering was done to get the mobility in radii of 1km to 5km based on the store location. The final sales value was kept as the dependent field for the model.\nMultiple model architectures were tried to model this information to correct the mobility, including ML and DL models. Finally, a voting ensemble method was selected which was modelling the corrected demand with an accuracy of about 70%.\nTo bump up the numbers further, an aerial snapshot of the region around the score was obtained from Google Satellite API at a tuned zoom level and a segmentation exercise was performed on the image to extract the type of region around the store. This was expected to bring another dimension of immediate demographics in the dataset. This was done by extracting the coverage area of different colors based on pixel masks :\nGrey (signifying roads, parking lots, streets, etc) Green (signifying agriculture, parks, vegetation, etc) White (signifying roof-tops, buildings, etc) IMPACT\nThe final model with all the variables included (engineered visits from proprietary data, Google mobility data, demographics data and derived immediate demographics of the store from satellite images) achieved a test accuracy of 75%.

While many vendors offer comprehensive IIoT solutions, we were looking for quicker and more cost-effective alternatives to deploying a sophisticated end-to-end platform.\nSOLUTION\nWe designed, deployed and tested a fully-functioning prototype on our client‚Äôs manufacturing floor in less than 4 weeks. Our solution utilized low-cost vibration sensors and accelerometers connected directly to selected machines.

The insights present on the dashboard included machine schedules, unplanned downtimes, overall availability and the number of times the machine was stopped. All of this was reported and updated real-time with a resolution of 4 minutes.\nIMPACT\nInstead of spending months and significant budget to deploy an end-to-end IIoT platform, our client was equipped with critical insights in a much shorter timeframe.

Also, since the transit included multiple contractors responsible for different stretches of the overall route, and nobody was taking responsibility for the damages, they were at a loss and had no idea how to rectify this.\nSOLUTION\nWe created an end-to-end asset tracking system for the client. The clients were given low-cost devices housing different sensors to include them with their shipments. These devices were very small (about 2cm x 2cm x 1cm) and were tested for harsh weather. Also, these devices were equipped with a battery, a GPS and cellular communication technology along with the accelerometer, humidity and temperature sensors. These were configured to be used as one time use devices to save on device recovery costs / logistics. They were configured to report information all along the journey and last the whole shipment time without the need of a recharge.\nThresholding was done on the accelerometer sensor housed in the device to store high impacts faced by it, which would directly correlate with the damage faced the equipment. These raw accelerometer values were then configured to be sent to the cloud managed by the manufacturer. This data was then available to be used using simple API requests.\nThe raw data collection and conversion to impact system was built on an application enablement platform. This resulted in quick prototyping and testing of the proof of concept. The processed data was then sent to a live dahsboard which was shared with the client for their perusal. This dashboard offered several important metrics such as the last known location, temperature and battery of the device. It also showed the impact values versus timestamp which were recorded by the device.\nIMPACT\nFrom using this solution, we were able to ascertain different impact values faced by the device during different portions of the journey. This helped the client to visualise and piece together possible regions where the shipment was getting damaged. Our analysis found that most of the impacts registered by the device were when the device was travelling from the factory to the ports, which was contrary to the earlier belief of the client that most of the damage was being caused during the ship route.

This library was chosen as this provided and open source FVM alternative to the licensed FEM solver, COMSOL. Apart from that, nobody in the firm had used it before, so it served as an exploration study into using this library. However, as I was able to finish the objective early, I also finished an extension of the project, which included studying the effects of electroporation on the drug transfer kinetics.\nDETAILS\nThe first task was to get used to the OpenFOAM library which is completely CLI based. After getting a handle of the different methods and way of working, the first model was developed of the uppermost skin layer, Stratum Corneum using a parameterised brick and mortar structure. This model was then used to model a transdermal drug delivery by Fickian diffusion through the layer.\nFentanyl and Caffeine were chosen to be studied based on literature review and their scope of usage in transdermal delivery. The diffusion coefficients for these components were obtained from MD simulations. Running them through the developed model provided drug release profiles for both. These profiles were validated by experimental studies present in literature.\nSince, there were a lot of files that needed to be modified to set up an OpenFOAM simulation, running iterations while maintaining correctness (not missing editing a file) was a steep task. Hence, I worked on automating the whole simulation process and file editing structure using C++ and Bash.

The aim of the study was to model an SiO2 burner with specific dimensions and study the temperature profiles of the burner. The project also included studiyng the distribution of different species present at different distances away from the flame.\nDETAILS\nTo kick off the modelling, adiabatic flame temperature was calculated for a hydrogen-oxygen combustion process. The equilibrium analysis was done on ASPEN Plus package. To validate the results, the same value was cross-referenced with literature values. It was found to be in good agreement with that. Next, a 100% conversion analysis was done using the same suite. However, this time the same model was built using first principles on MATLAB and the results were compared. Again, there was a very good agreement with both of these values. Hence, we concluded that the modelling process done in the ASPEN Plus suite is correct.\nHaving validated our model, we started experimenting with different conditions for the same process. This included changing the temperature as well as adding Silicon Tetrachloride in the feed. Finally, a dependence between the hydrogen flow rate with the adiabatic temperature was established.\nNext, we moved on to the kinetics of the problem. The overall reaction was broken down into several different intermediate reactions. Every one of these intermediate reactions have different kinetic parameters. All the possible intermediate reactions were written and validated with theory and literature. Preliminary reaction kinetics were performed with an assumed value of burner diameter and were qualitatively checked with literature values.\nIMPACT\nHaving a validated model ready for use, the original burner dimensions used by the industrial partner were added to the model and all the calculations were re-run for this.

This provided much better view into the temperature variation in the flame and the different reaction progress with the length of the flame. This gave the industrial partner insights into the minimum length of the flame to ensure that the reaction gets over and a maximum conversion of raw materials to products can be achieved with minimal waste.\n","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"52259abf97ccb4a6e46c9408e9cced1b","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/burnerprofile/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/burnerprofile/","section":"project","summary":"Performed a numerical study of SiO2 burner profiles simulating a burner flame and calculating the flame temperature profile and species distribution in the flame.","tags":["Chemical Engineering","Burner profile","Adiabatic Temperature Calculation","MATLAB","COMSOL","ANSYS Chemkin","ASPEN Plus"],"title":"Numerical Study of SiO2 Burner profiles","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"AIM\nThis was an Undergraduate project under Prof. Nishith Verma which went on from March 2016 to December 2016.

This resulted in fluid flow diagrams which were matched with experiments. After validating this model, tracer analysis was done on the outputs. This ensured us to capture the cross section and the mixing capabilities of the mixer. This was again validated from experiments.\nHaving a C++ lattice boltzmann model ready, we moved on to using the palabos library to include population balance equations in our simulation model. This included the new calculations as well as sped up the entire code by about 40%. Nucleation rates and growth rates for the different particles were provided based on experimental chemical reactions and the population density of the product was studied at different cross sections of the mixer representing varying mixer sizes.\n","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"6bb36ab7b26abb182522c38b0f6db3e2","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/ymixer/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ymixer/","section":"project","summary":"Performed a simulation study of nanoparticle precipitation in 2D and 3D Y-mixers solving the population balance equation.

This ensured much better construction as giving a dihedral in the middle is very tricky. These were carefully built to maintian the same angle to ensure roll stability.

We however decided to perform a very different study using the same equipment.\nDETAILS\nDuring our experiments, we noticed that there was a measurable gap between turning up the RPM of the motor and actually observing differences in the flow rate. This lead us to believe that there is some sort of a lag in play between the inputs and outputs. To model this lag, we assumed first order dynamics for simplicity and calculated the transfer function of the pump ny oberving the time difference it takes to reach equilibrium after giving the input. We later tested this obtained transfer function by further experimenting with the setup.\nTo ensure utmost accuracy in our calculation, we used high FPS cameras to record readings when we were giving a small step change as an input to the motor (change of RPM).

The problem statements are carefully curated to encourage design innovations in the field of robotics. The theme of the competition for the year 2016 was \u0026ldquo;Clean Energy recharging of world\u0026rdquo;. The problem statement was to make 2 robots, one being a powered robot and the other being a non-powered robot that will move using non-contact forces provided by the former. The aim was to make the non-powered robot travel on a path with elevation, curves, sharp turns etc autonomously using line following. This bot was carrying a lightweight fan. The other robot, in addition to providing the required force for the non-powered robot to move, had to collect the aforementioned fan from the non-powered robot after it had covered the entire stretch, climb a pole and then place the fan on the top of the pole. This would mark the completion (\u0026ldquo;Chai-Yo\u0026rdquo; as they called it) of the challenge and the team that achieves this first would win.\nDETAILS\nI was one of the leaders in the 21 member team that took part in the competition represting my alma mater, IIT Kanpur. We worked on this from October 2015 to March 2016. We managed to achieve that participated from different technical institutions from all across India.\nWe chose to go with wind as the mode of force to move the non-powered robot. We used a propellor fan to generate the wind and a styrofoam sail was attached to the non-powered robot to catch the wind and propel it forward. This bot was made using lightweight balse wood and glass fibre which have an impressive strenght-to-weight ratio. We further designed the truss patterns on the wood and got it cut by laser to have the lightest possible bot. We also employed line tracking on the bot to follow the required path. These prototypes were first designed on Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks and then cut and assembled using precise machinery.\nThe powered bot had an autonomous climbing mechanism using rubberised clamp wheels. To follow the path and align itself to the pole, it used wall following to follow the arena wall. We were consistently able to achieve \u0026ldquo;Chai-Yo\u0026rdquo; in about 50 seconds of runtime (You can take a look at the video which has the complete run while we were still preparing for the competition).\n","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"4ea3cf7e5a8663511adae3ca8118c1e5","permalink":"https://prasang-gupta.github.io/project/robocon16/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/robocon16/","section":"project","summary":"Designed 2 robots as a part of the ABU ROBOCON 2016 challenge, one being a powered robot and the other being a non-powered robot that will move using non-contact forces provided by the former and steer using line following.
